<h2>Learning Stateful Models for Network Honeypots</h2> 

<p>Attacks like call fraud and identity theft often involve sophisticated
stateful attack patterns which, on top of normal communication, try to
harm systems on a higher semantic level than usual attack
scenarios. To detect these kind of threats via specially deployed
honeypots, at least a minimal understanding of the inherent state
machine of a specific service is needed to lure potential attackers
and to keep a communication for a sufficiently large number of
steps. To this end we propose 
<!-- PRISMA, a -->
<a href="talks/prismatalk.pdf"> PRISMA</a>, a
method for <i>protocol inspection and state machine analysis</i>,
which infers a functional state machine and message format of a
protocol from network traffic alone. We apply our method to three
real-life network traces ranging from 10,000 up to 2 million messages
of both binary and textual protocols. We show that PRISMA is capable
of simulating complete and correct sessions based on the learned
models. A use case on malware traffic reveals the different states of
the execution, rendering PRISMA a valuable tool for malware
analysis.</p>
<p>See also a <a href="talks/prismalecture.pdf">lecture</a> about this
topic held at the University of Goettingen which additionally
introduces some basic statistical methods.
Furthermore, we have prepared an R package PRISMA hosted
  on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PRISMA/index.html">CRAN</a>. 

<h2>Fast Cross-Validation via Sequential Analysis</h2>

With the increasing size of today's data sets, finding the right
parameter configuration via cross-validation can be an extremely
time-consuming task. In this <a href="talks/fastcv.pdf">talk</a> we propose an improved
cross-validation procedure which uses non-parametric testing coupled
with sequential analysis to determine the best parameter set on
linearly increasing subsets of the data. By eliminating
underperforming candidates quickly and keeping promising candidates as
long as possible the method speeds up the computation while preserving
the capability of the full cross-validation. The experimental
evaluation shows that our method reduces the computation time by a
factor of up to 120 compared to a full cross-validation with a
negligible impact on the accuracy. Code is available as package CVST
on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CVST/index.html">CRAN</a>. 

<h2>ASAP: Automatic Semantics-Aware Analysis of Network Payloads</h2>

Automatic inspection of network payloads is a prerequisite for
effective analysis of network communication. Security research has
largely focused on network analysis using protocol specifications, for
example for intrusion detection, fuzz testing and forensic
analysis. The specification of a protocol alone, however, is often not
sufficient for accurate analysis of communication, as it fails to
reflect individual semantics of network applications. In
our <a href="talks/asap.pdf">talk</a> we propose a framework for
semantics-aware analysis of network payloads which automatically
extracts semantics-aware components from recorded network traffic. Our
method proceeds by mapping network payloads to a vector space and
identifying communication templates corresponding to base directions
in the vector space. We demonstrate the efficacy of semantics-aware
analysis in different security applications: automatic discovery of
patterns in honeypot data, analysis of malware communication and
network intrusion detection.

<h2>TokDoc: A Self-Healing Web Application Firewall</h2> The growing
amount of web-based attacks poses a severe threat to the security of
web applications. Signature-based detection techniques increasingly
fail to cope with the vari- ety and complexity of novel attack
instances. As a remedy, we introduce in
our <a href="talks/tokdoc.pdf">talk</a> a protocol-aware reverse HTTP
proxy TokDoc (the token doctor), which intercepts requests and decides
on a per-token basis whether a token requires automatic "healing". In
particular, we propose an intelligent mangling technique, which, based
on the decision of previously trained anomaly detectors, replaces
suspicious parts in requests by benign data the system has seen in the
past. Evaluation of our system in terms of accuracy is performed on
two real- world data sets and a large variety of recent attacks. In
com- parison to state-of-the-art anomaly detectors, TokDoc is not only
capable of detecting most attacks, but also significantly outperforms
the other methods in terms of false positives.  Runtime measurements
show that our implementation can be deployed as an inline intrusion
prevention system.

<h2>An Architecture for Inline Anomaly Detection</h2>

In this <a href="talks/fips.pdf">talk</a> we propose an intrusion
prevention system (IPS) which operates inline and is capable to detect
unknown attacks using anomaly detection methods. Incorporated in
the framework of a packet filter each incoming packet is analyzed and
- according to an internal connection state and a computed anomaly
score - either delivered to the production system, redirected to a
special hardened system or logged to a network sink for later
analysis. Runtime measurements of an actual implementation prove
that the performance overhead of the system is sufficient for inline
processing. Accuracy measurements on real network data yield
improvements especially in the number of false positives, which are
reduced by a factor of five compared to a plain anomaly detector.
